This repository contains all code for katas that I find interesting/challenging/elegant.

My Codewars account: [link](https://www.codewars.com/users/osovv)

I try to make a small description for every Kata, where I show top voted solution and leave comments on the process of implementing the solution or thoughts about task.

My first ~30 Katas are not here. Some of them are too easy. Some were solved a long time ago so I don't remember what I was thinking in proccess of solution or maybe I'm just too lazy to add them.
